## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

## Acknowledgments

- I used PostgreSQL as a database for this, however, I write all the SQL queries inside pgAdmin instead of using the CLI.
- I already had kwnoledge of MSSQL, and MSSQL management studio, that kwnoledge I implemented here, with PostgreSQL.
